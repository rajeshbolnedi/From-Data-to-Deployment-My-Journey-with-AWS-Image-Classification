# From-Data-to-Deployment-My-Journey-with-AWS-Image-Classification
AWS Image Classification Project:
This project utilizes AWS SageMaker and AWS Lambda to automate image classification in real-time. The workflow includes data preparation, model training, deployment, and automated inference. The entire process is triggered by S3 events, allowing for efficient and automated image classification whenever new images are uploaded to a specified S3 bucket.

Project Overview:
The primary goal of this project is to classify images using AWS's machine learning and serverless infrastructure. By leveraging SageMaker's built-in image classification algorithm and Lambda functions, this solution enables real-time predictions with minimal manual intervention.

Architecture:
1.	Data Preparation on Amazon S3
	Images are stored in S3, divided into training and validation sets.
.lst files are generated to label images, ensuring accurate model training.
2.	Model Training with SageMaker
The SageMaker image classification algorithm is used to train the model.
Key hyperparameters include:
	num_layers: The number of layers in the model.
	epochs: The number of training iterations.
	mini_batch_size: The size of data batches for training.
The trained model is stored in S3 for deployment.
3.	Model Deployment and Inference with AWS Lambda
The model is deployed to a SageMaker endpoint.
A Lambda function invokes the SageMaker endpoint for real-time predictions.
4.	Automation Using S3 Events
S3 events are configured to trigger the Lambda function whenever a new image is uploaded, automating the classification process.

Requirements:
To run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
•	AWS Account with permissions to access SageMaker, Lambda, and S3 services.
•	AWS CLI installed and configured.
•	Boto3 Python SDK for AWS.

Setup and Execution:
1.	Data Preparation
Upload your images to an S3 bucket, organizing them into training and validation folders.	Generate .lst files for labeling. You can use SageMaker's tools or custom scripts for this step.
2.	Model Training
Create a SageMaker training job, selecting the built-in image classification algorithm.
Set your hyperparameters and initiate training.
Monitor the training process and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
3.	Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint.
Test the endpoint using sample images to ensure accurate predictions.
4.	Lambda Integration
Create a Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint for inference.
Configure the function to receive image data from S3 and process predictions.
5.	Automate with S3 Events
Set up an event notification on the S3 bucket to trigger the Lambda function on image uploads.
Confirm automation by uploading test images and reviewing classification results.

Key Insights:
•	Data Structuring: Proper data organization and labeling upfront save time during training and validation.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting parameters such as num_layers, epochs, and mini_batch_size can greatly impact model accuracy.
•	Seamless Integration: AWS Lambda functions streamline integration between services and enable real-time automation.
•	Event-Driven Processing: Using S3 events reduces the need for manual intervention, allowing for scalable and real-time image classification.

Conclusion:
This project showcases how to leverage AWS's powerful ML and serverless tools for efficient, automated image classification. The setup can be extended or modified to support various classification tasks and image data types, making it a versatile solution for many applications
